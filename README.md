# TollBooth
This is a simple Java-based terminal application designed for toll booth data management. The program tracks vehicles passing through the toll booth, categorizing them based on whether they pay the toll fee of $0.50 or bypass payment. It maintains a count of both paying and non-paying vehicles and calculates the total revenue collected in dollars. Additionally, it provides a summary report displaying the total number of vehicles that passed without paying. This project is a basic implementation of data tracking and financial computation in a toll booth system.

* __Check Detais__ Select this option to view existing records.
